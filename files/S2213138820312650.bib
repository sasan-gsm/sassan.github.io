abstract = {Combining wind power with pumped-storage systems is trustworthy for reducing the unreliability of wind energy, caused by the variable nature of the wind for contributing to the grid's peak shaving. Locating suitable sites for constructing both wind parks and pumped-storage systems for peak shaving is a delicate problem-solving. For solving such problems, a wide range of technical, financial, and environmental criteria should be taken into account. A two-step decision framework combining GIS, Analytic Network Process (ANP) and fuzzy VIKOR are proposed in this paper to solve the problem for locating the suitable sites for constructing a wind-powered pump storage plant. In the first step, a GIS database is developed to locate a handful potential sites within the study area. As there are different and even conflicting criteria involved with site selection problem. In the second step, we used an MCDM approach of fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) and fuzzy VIKOR to rank these potential sites. To establish an evaluation system, four major clusters of criteria are introduced (wind farm, water reservoir, water pump and power production) with more addition related sub-criteria. Comprehensive guidelines are formulated through a hierarchical procedure so a data-driven, multi-aspect decision framework could be presented with the goal of improving the benefits of integrated renewable energies. The results show that, the Gilane-Gharb dam is the most promising site within the study area. This site provides a net area of 13.2 km2 for constructing a wind farm with an approximate power capacity of 31Â MW. The proposed procedure in this is a framework that are provide a theoretical reference for resolving any multicriteria decision-making problem by introducing the appropriate criteria.}
